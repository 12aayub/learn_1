1. Asynchronous JavaScript is when you have multiple lines of code without the requirement of running them sequentially. A previously started function can run after it receives information from a later function that obtains information for it.

2. Application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. It allows different software to interact with each other.

3. A callback is a function which is passed into another function as a parameter.

4. An example of a callback would be

function mainFunction(otherFunction) {
  return otherFunction()
}

6. A promise is an object that provides 2 separate outcomes (resolve or reject) for an asynchronous function.

7.

  var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    resolve(x);
    reject(y);
  })
